# etl-search-engine
The project involves designing a data analytics solution to address the challenges associated with accessing and comparing nutritional information from various vitamin and supplement manufacturers. To tackle this issue, my group have created a search engine for supplements that prioritizes data accuracy and consistency. This system will help users find the right products to meet their nutritional needs efficiently. The solution encompasses the design of a data warehouse, an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process pipeline, and an API interface for user interaction. Leveraging MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and Flask, the project integrates multiple data sources, providing a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for accessing supplement information.
